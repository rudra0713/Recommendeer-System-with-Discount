# Recommendeer-System-with-Discount

Recommender Systems (RS) play a vital role in applications such as e-commerce and on-demand content streaming. Most RS mainly focuses on the customer perspective, however few
techniques are built for revenue maximization of manufacturers. We want to explore and exploit a novel connection between RS and the profitability of a business. 
We  developed a novel discount strategy on products. To increase sales revenue, the retailer(e.g. Amazon, Superstores ) usually add some 
level of discount on certain item/items in order to sell more products(i.e. increase the probability of purchase). However, a recommendation strategy solely focused on
maximizing profit may eventually lose consumer's trust. Therefore, we propose a discount scheme based profit maximization strategy along with two novel trust functions that the vendor i.e. the strategy should satisfy. Finally, we perform rigorous experiments on Amazon dataset to show the merit of our approaches.
